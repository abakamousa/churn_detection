# About
This project present machine learning based solution for churn identification using past data ().

## Objective

The goal here is to provide an accurate model to predict if a customer will churn, given the ~170 columns containing customer behavior, usage patterns, payment patterns, and other features that might be relevant. 

## Dataset 

The dataset is provided by kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/telecom-churn-case-study-hackathon-c54/data

In order to use that dataset on collab, you will need to follow the steps below:

- Create a Kaggle account on https://www.kaggle.com. 
- In the "Account" tab of your user profile (https://www.kaggle.com/ \<username>\/account), select "Create API Token". This will trigger a download of kaggle.json.
- Open the json file and you will find the username and the key. 
- Copy the key and paste it into the notebook cell when prompted.
